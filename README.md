# GetAndCleaningDataProject

 Project repository for Getting and Cleaning Data Course.  
 
 The project requires a script called run_analysis.R.  
 You need to download and extract the archive data at (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) to a folder named data. 
 
 You can then execute the run_analysis.R on that dataset which will output the results to a text file named tidy_final_data.txt in the same data folder.
 
 A codebook with a variables description and the report of modofocations done on the original dataset is available in the repository, it is named CodeBook.md.
